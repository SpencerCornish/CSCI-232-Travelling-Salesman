# Travelling Salesman Lab
The purpose of this lab was to understand different approaches to solving the Travelling Salesman Problem. 

  The Lab description is quoted below:
  >In this lab, you will write a program to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). TSP is one of the classic “hard” problems in CS so we’ll explore some heuristic approaches to solve it. Briefly, a salesman wishes to visit each city exactly once and return to the city he started at least total cost. (This problem is also called the Hamiltonian cycle problem.)



  Two approaches were used in this project:
  #### Greedy Heuristic
  > A greedy approach that goes to the nearest unvisited vertex
  #### A "Twice Around the Tree" Heuristic
  > the “twice-around-the-tree” method; first find a minimum spanning tree T, then, starting at root “walk around the tree” (this can be done using a recursive tree traversal; you will need to figure out the details) and write down the list of vertices encountered; after the list is constructed remove duplicate vertices.
